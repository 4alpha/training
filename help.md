Q & A session


NOTES:


Open source
Closed source
Defination
The open source software in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change,and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.
closed-source software involves the use of constraints on what can be done with the 	software and the restriction of access to the original source code
Innovation
The source code is open source that is anyone can look into it and can change it.
This innovation, however, may not be passed on to all users. 
The source code is closed that is only the developer itself can look into it and change it.
It ensures the security and reliability of closed software that is fully tested and offered to all users.
Cost
Open source is a free of cost that is we do not need to pay for it but if we need some extra services then for that user need to pay.
To use closed source we need to pay this not means that they give you ownership,we pay for used that s/w only.
Support/services
Open source software deliver support via forums and blogs, but this support often 	fails to deliver the high level of response that many consumers expect .
Support includes detailed documentation, forums, wikis, newsgroups, email ,lists and live chat. 
Service and support are probably the greatest advantages of using proprietary closed source.
Support includes user manuals and points of contact for immediate assistance from viable companies with experts who are intimately familiar with the products and services.

Usability
Usability is often a major area of criticism for open source software because the 	 technology is generally not reviewed by usability experts and caters to developers rather than the vast majority of layperson users.
For closed source software, usability is a high selling point due to expert 	usability testing for a more targeted audience.

Security
Security of open source is often a concern for large companies because software is not always developed in a controlled environment.One way to reduce this potential risk is to adopt a reputable brand with a concentrated development team supported by a strong online community.
Closed software is generally seen as more secure because it is developed in a controlled environment by a concentrated team with a common 	direction. 
Bugs
Because large open source software projects can literally have millions of eyes examining the source code, there is a much higher probability that more bugs are exposed.

 Compair to open source  there are less bugs becouse code from a closed source vendor with a far smaller development staff.  

Time line
It’s continually evolving in real time as developers add to it and modify it,
The majority of closed source software is pushed into the market long before it’s ready. Many software companies view this practice as crucial to the development/testing of the product.
Vendor lock in
Open source is envolved in real time so vendor not lock it becouse it update frequently.
A dependency on the future versions and upgrades for a closed source software package can create vendor lock-in, entrenching a monopoly position. 
Example
1)Networking environment-Linux
2)Web browsers-Firefox
3)Peer to peer file sharing programs-Fost wire
4)security-AVG      Antivirus/ClamAV

1)Networking environment-Microsoft Windows
2)Web browsers-Internet Explorer,opera,safari
3)Peer to peer file sharing programs-Lime Wire
4)security-Norton antivirus



Open source licence type:
		1)    Apache License 2.0
		2)    3-clause BSD license
		3)    2-clause BSD license
		4)    GNU General Public License version 2
            	5)    MIT license
		6)    Mozilla Public License 1.1
		7)    Eclipse Public License 1.0
open-source licenses may have some restrictions, particularly regarding the expression of respect to the origin of software, such as a requirement to preserve the name of the authors and a copyright statement within the code.they have limited time period and functionality.

End User
	The end user is the individual who uses the product after it has been fully developed, marketed, and installed. It is also the person who keeps calling the "IT guy" with questions about why the product isn't working correctly. Generally, the terms "user" and "end user" mean the same thing.

User Guide
	User guide also known as manual, is a technical document contains all essential information for the user to make full use of the information system.  This manual includes a description of the system functions and capabilities, contingencies and step-by-step procedures, trubleshooting, FAQ and glossary.

Technical
	Code-code is nothing but the set of instructions that can be put together in computer to perform some action. Also we learn some new logic from code.
	
	Tutorial-A tutorial is a method of transferring knowledge and may be used as a part of a learning process. It is interactive than book or a lecture, a tutorial seeks to teach by example and supply the information to complete a certain task.

	Samples-Samples are nothing but the related task, or code which will help to build up logic and also  solve problems while writting program. 

	API-An (Application Programming Interface) API is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software. It helps to developed a program easily.

Research / Self help
	Research or self help is finding correct solution :
--help – This command provide quick overview of given command and its uses.
Syntax : [command] --help  

man – This gives brief discription of given command i.e name, synopsis, discription, return value, attributes, sytnax etc.

Code base – It refers to a whole collection of source code that is used to build a particular software system, application, or software component.

Git bugs – Using git bugs we can find solution on problem. Also we can share our problem to get right solution from technical person.

Test case – A test case is a set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine whether a system under test satisfies requirements or works correctly. 

Google –  Also we can find solution of problem using google search.

Stackoverflow -This is online community for programmer to learn, share their knowledge.

Peer

Subordintes- 
	Getting solution to perticular level.

Forum-
	A meeting or medium where ideas and views on a particular issue can be exchanged. Also online forum is an discussion site where people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages.

Discussion board-
	It is a online discussion site where people can hold conversation in the form of posted msg. Many websites offer discussion board so that user can share and discuss information and their opinion.

Review
	A review is a systematic examination of a document by one or more people with the main aim of finding and removing errors. Reviews are used to verify documents such as requirements, system designs, code, test plans and test cases.


What is release notes?
Release notes are documents that are distributed with software products,sometime when product is still in development or test state.Eor products that have already been use by clients,the releas note is  deliverd to clients when update is released.
	There is no standerd format for release notes that is followed throughout organization.Organization normally adopt their own formating styles based on requirement and type of information circulated.

What is API/Reference?
In computer programming Application Programming Interface is set of subroutine definations,protocols and tools for building application software.API contains interfaces,classes,methods related with perticular programming language.If any method is required frequently or number of times then we should have to search it in related API /Refernce.
Ex-In java  we required concate,reverse,tostring etc methods ,which are already define in API we just have to use them; but for that purpouse we should have to know which functions or classes are part of API.Therefore we have to search AIPs, which is good to become a good programmer.

What is Tutorials? 
Tutorial is a method of transforming the knowledge and may be used as a learning process.More interactive and specific than books or lectures,tutorials seeks to teach by examples and supply the information to complete the task.
Ex-In market lot of Tutorial videos are available on youtube,javatpoint ,w3school are the websites for learn languages or topics using tutrials.
We can learn more using tutorials than books or teaching.

Knowledge base-
	Knowledge base is technollogy used to store structured and unstructured information used by the computer sysetm.Structured information means the information which have pre-defined data model or organized in pre-define manner and unstructured information is totally oposite of structured information.
	Using knowledge base we will get good level knowledge.We get knowledge from structured information as well as someone post issues on it and the technical person gives solution for it.
